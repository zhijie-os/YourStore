            <p>Omnipotent Youth Society (Chinese: 万能青年旅店; pinyin: Wàn Néng Qīng Nián Lǚ Diàn) (OYS), is a 
                Chinese alternative rock band that was formed in the late '90s in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, an 
                industrial city in northern China. Currently it has four members: Dong Yaqian (Er Qian) (lead 
                vocals, guitar), Ji Geng (bass), Yang Yougeng (Xiao Geng) (drums) and Shi Li (trumpet). Most 
                songs were written by Dong Yaqian (music) and Ji Geng (lyrics).</p>

            <p>OYS released its first self-titled album in November 2010, almost 10 years after the foundation. 
                There are five members in OYS, including the singer Dong, bass player Ji, the drummer Geng, the 
                trumpet player Shi and the saxophone player Lee. The first album brings a heated discussion of 
                Chinese new pop rock because, since the time of Cui Jian, there hasn’t really been a band or 
                musician who has made a major splash in some time. The OYS made audience moved with their 
                unique theme and simple melody, which is unlike the love theme in current mandopop.</p>

            <p>Analysis of Lyrics
                The poetic and meaningful lyrics contributes a lot to OYS’s infectious performance. Most of OYS’s 
                songs didn’t depicted the love theme as other mandopop songs did, instead, they depicted their 
                authentic life in the declining industrial city- Shijiazhuang. Along with the melody, we can feel 
                a deep depression and helplessness from the lyrics. Here we choose three of them to explain illustrate 
                why they reflect the deep depression without even mentioning the word depression. Through the 
                analysis of yixiang in OYS’s lyrics, we have had a general idea of what kind of feelings are involved 
                in their songs: depression and helplessness. They expressed some kinds of helplessness, they are 
                generated due to different social changes at that time. In OYS’s songs, we could feel a lot more 
                helplessness generated by the Reform and Open Up policy and the urbanization at that time.</p>
